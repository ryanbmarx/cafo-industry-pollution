/*

## TODO
- Consider whether the dots should scale with the dead fish
- Decide what data needs to be in the profile.
- We're gonna need some geolocating help, but still don't have real data.
- Programatically trigger a click so the buttons sync with the initial map data.
- Figure out how to change color state of dots on click.
